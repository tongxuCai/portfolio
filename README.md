# My data project portfolio at Columbia Journalism School's Data Journalism program 2019-2020 

This repository contains d3 and JS code to visualize the datasets either assigned at computation homework or information I found online for practice. 

# Data

Most datasets are assigned by instructor, primarily to practice d3 skills. The one for practice project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/haimfeld87/top-35-israeli-stocks-5-years-data) and is originially extracted from [Tel Aviv Stock Exchange](https://www.tase.co.il/en/market_data/index/142/tracking_products/etf).

# Methodology / Code / Findings

With the templating system Sawhorse, I set up new projects, generate my mainpage, and add the handlebars of each projects' to the page.

# Analysis notebook 
With much help from the instructor, TAs and fellow classmates, I am now capable of visualizing both local datasets and ones that require server-running. First, I generate a new sawhorse project, create an SVG, read in data, and add whatever feasible visualizations with functions to present the data. If multiple SVGs are needed, I draw containers. So far, I have created static d3 charts, interactive (clickable) ones, responsive ai2html images and scrollytelling pieces.
